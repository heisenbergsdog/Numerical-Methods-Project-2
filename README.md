# Numerical-Methods-Project-2

This is the code for a numerical methods problem set. It contains four questions, all relating to using linear algebra to approximate functions in the coding language Julia. The function of focus of this problem set is the sine function and a method similar to a taylor series is used to approximate it. <img width="397" alt="error of cosine derivative approx" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444009/216790476-3d9c3b56-3f12-450b-9715-abc19626f23a.png">
